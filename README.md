# Flashcard-quiz-system
This project is intended to:

- Develop an interactive console application that helps users learn and test English‚ÄìGerman vocabulary 
- Apply basic Python programming concepts learned in the Programming Foundations module
- Demonstrate the use of console interaction, data validation, and file processing
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code

---
**Problem**

  Around 15.4 million people learn German as a foreign language worldwide. Many people struggle with memorizing vocabulary, which leads to slower learning progress, mental frustration and poor progress overview.  


---
**Scenario**

 The user opens the program. The program loads word pairs from a file, presents them in random
order, and asks the user to translate each word. The program count‚Äôs the amount of tries used and displays it when you entered the right word. If the user doesn‚Äôt know an
answer, he has the option to show the answer and skip it.

--- 

**User stories:**

1. As a user, I want to practise my english - german vocabulary in the console. 
2. As a user, I want to track my learning progress.
3. As a user, I want to see the correct answer, in case I can not answer it myself.

**Use cases:**

- Provide or use a vacabulary list with word pairs (flashcard_words.csv)
- Practise vocabulary (flashcard_app_with_csv_db.py)
- Skip unknown words
- Track progress (user_progress.txt)


---

## Project Requirements
1. Interactive app (console input)
2. Data validation (input checking)
3. File processing (read/write)

---
### 1. Interactive App (Console Input)
The application interacts with the user via the console. Users can:

- Choose the language 
- Enter translation
- Skip unknown words
- Exit the program

---

### 2. Data Validation
The application validates all user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience. The program validates the following points:
- If a valid language was chosen at the beginning
```python
language = ""
while language not in ("english", "german"):
    language = input("Choose the quiz language: German or English:\n ").strip().lower()
```
This ensures only valid language is chosen. 

- If the words from the csv file were loaded. The program validates the vocabulary file and checks its readability.
```python 
def load_flashcards():
    flashcards = []
    try:
        with open("flashcard_words.csv", "r") as f:
            reader = csv.DictReader(f)
            flashcards = list(reader)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  File 'flashcard_words.csv' not found.")
        return False
    return flashcards
```
```python
def main():
    #load cards
    flashcards = load_flashcards()
    if not flashcards: #Checks if file was loaded
        print('Exiting')
        return
```
This ensures the program only operates when valid data file was loaded. 

- If digits or letters were inserted by the user. The program validates user responses. 
```python 
if not user_answer.isalpha() :
            print('Invalid Input, only words are accepted')

```

This ensures that the input contains only valid characters and prevents invalid inputs from being counted or stored in the results file (user_progress.txt). 
 

---
### 3. File Processing
The program reads and writes data using files:
- **Input file:** `flashcard_words.csv` - Contains the table of words and its translations per line in the format `English,German,type`.
    - Example:
		```
        house,Haus,noun
        difficult,schwierig,adjective
        zero,null,numeral
        ```
    - The program reads this file at the beginning to display words in a random order.

- **Output file:** `user_progress.txt` It writes the words that the user entered correct in a additional txt file. It contains a summary of the progressed words. 
    - Example:
		```
        safe  
        rule  
        besuchen  
        Flughafen  
        tun    
        ```
    - The output file serves as a record for the user to keep track of the progress.

## Implementation

### Technology
- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces, PyCharm and Visual Studio Code
- Libraries: random and csv

 ### Repository Structure
 ```text
Flashcard-quiz-system/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flashcard_app_with_csv_db.py    # Main program logic (console application)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flashcard_words.csv             # Table with all the words in english and german
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_progress.txt               # Words that the user progressed
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # Project description and milestones
```


 ### How to Run
 1. Open the repository in **GitHub Codespaces**
2. Open the **Terminal**
3. Run:
	```bash

    python3 flashcard_app_with_csv_db.py

    ```

 ### Libraries Used

 - ¬¥random¬¥: Module is used to select random words from the csv file, and shuffling order flashcards presented to the user. 
 - ¬¥csv¬¥: Allows to read data, word pairs (english-german) in ¬¥flashcard_words.csv¬¥ file.

In this program were used only Python standard libraries, with no external installations required. These libraries were chosen because of their simplicity, effectiveness and reliability, while managing files and data processing in a console application.
